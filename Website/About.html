      Hi! My name is Elizabeth. I answer to most nicknames including Liz, Lizzie, and Eliza. The only nickname I hate is Beth. I grew up as a military brat so I've lived all over the place, but have been in Colorado for the past 4 years.</p></center>

<center><h2>College</h2><center>
      <center><p>I went to College of Charleston in Charleston, SC. I majored in Psychology with an emphasis in behavioral psychology. During college I worked as behavioral therapist doing ABA therapy with children diagnoised on the autism spectrum. I was a D1 student athlete and rode for CofC's equestrian team.</p></center>
